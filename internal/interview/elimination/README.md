In this interview, I was asked to provide code that would
eliminate cells with 3 or more consecutive identical values
horizontally or vertically on a 2D board.

Cells have values 1-9, the board is an MxN matrix.

Elimination is done by overwriting the value with a 0.

The solution here is a clean approach done many days after
the interview.
